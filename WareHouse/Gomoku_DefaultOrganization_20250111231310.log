Python is a suitable choice for this task due to its simplicity and readability, which can help in quickly developing the game logic. Additionally, Python has extensive libraries like Pygame for creating games, making it an ideal option for this project. Therefore, I propose using Python for this Gomoku game development.

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a basic Gomoku game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a basic Gomoku game.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a basic Gomoku game..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To develop a basic Gomoku game using Python, we will use the tkinter library for creating the GUI. The game will have a 15x15 board where players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the board. The first player to get five of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods we will need:

1. `GameBoard`: Manages the game board, including placing marks, checking for a win, and resetting the board.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the game board with an empty 15x15 grid.
   - `place_mark`: Places a mark on the board at a given position.
   - `check_win`: Checks if there is a winning combination of five marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - `reset_board`: Resets the game board to its initial state.

2. `GameUI`: Handles the GUI elements and user interactions.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the GUI with the GameBoard instance.
   - `create_widgets`: Creates and places the GUI elements (buttons, labels) on the screen.
   - `handle_button_click`: Updates the game board when a button is clicked.

3. `main` file: The entry point of the application.
   - `if __name__ == "__main__":`: Runs the GameUI instance to start the game.

Here's the code for each file:

**game_board.py**
```python
class GameBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]

    def check_win(self, mark):

        for row in range(15):
